    <h1> Interview Presentation</h1>
    <h2> Be Yourself </h2>
    <p>Pay attention to the signals that your body language and eye contact send to the hiring team. It’s okay to be a little nervous (and even to show it—it means you care!). But try to relax and be yourself. Let your personality shine so that the hiring team glimpses who you truly are. If you have a sense of humor, use it to chuckle (appropriately, of course) or express an idea occasionally.

Your hiring manager may ask questions that seem trivial—for example, questions about a foreign country mentioned on your resume, or about pets. In fact they may be attempting to get to know you better on a personal level, to find out whether you will be someone they’d like to see in the office everyday.</p>
